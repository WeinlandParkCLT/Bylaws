5. Procedures for Altering the Resale Formula. The consistent long-term application of
a resale formula is essential to the purposes of the Corporation. Accordingly, the resale
formula shall not be altered unless the Board of Directors and Regular Members of the
Corporation determine that the current formula presents an obstacle to the achievement
of the purposes of the Corporation. In such event, the resale formula may be altered
only by a two-thirds vote of the entire Board of Directors and a two thirds vote of the
Regular Members present at a Membership meeting, as described above for the adoption
of the formula.
