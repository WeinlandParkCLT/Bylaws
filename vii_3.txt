3. The Resale Formula. Whenever its purpose is to preserve affordability, the
Corporation shall restrict the price that ground lessees may receive when they sell
housing and other improvements located on the land that is leased to them by the
Corporation. The same policy shall be applied in the case of condominium units
stewarded by the Corporation, regardless of whether the land is owned by the
Corporation. A policy establishing such restrictions in the form of a “resale formula”
shall be adopted by the Board of Directors and the Regular Members of the Corporation,
in accordance with the following principles:
a. To the extent possible, the formula shall allow the seller to receive a price based on
the value that the seller has actually invested in the property being sold.
b. To the extent possible, the formula shall limit the price of the property to an amount
that will be affordable for other low-income [or low and moderate income] people at
the time of the transfer of ownership.
