2. Preservation of Affordability. It is a purpose of the Corporation to preserve the
affordability of housing and other improvements for low-income [or low and moderate
income] people in the future. Accordingly, when land is leased for such purpose, the
Board of Directors shall assure that, as a condition of the lease, housing on the land may
be resold only to the Corporation or to another low-income [or low or moderate income]
person and only for a price limited by a “resale formula” as described in Section 3 below.
However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors may choose, for reasons
consistent with the charitable purposes of the Corporation, to lease certain parcels of land
for uses that do not require continued affordability for low-income [or low or moderate
income] people, and in such cases the resale restrictions described above shall not be
required as a condition of the lease.
