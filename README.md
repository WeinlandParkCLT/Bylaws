Bylaws
======

You can edit files in the browser by clicking on the file and then selecting edit over on the right.

Before doing that, I encourage you to create your own branch of the bylaws. That way, you can make all the changes you want to your branch and we can merge them back to the 'master' branch after discussion. To create a branch, click on the dropdown that says 'branch: master' and enter a name for the branch in the text field that appears.

If you have any questions, email me at eric101111@gmail.com.
