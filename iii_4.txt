voting at the Annual Meeting, a quorum being assembled, in accordance with the
following procedures.
a. A separate vote shall be taken for each of the three categories of Board
representatives: (1) Lessee Representatives, (2) General Representatives, and (3)
Public Representatives. If a person has been nominated in more than one category
and is then elected in one category, his or her name shall be removed from the list of
nominees in the remaining categories.
b. Only Lessee Members may vote to elect Lessee Representatives unless no Lessee
members are present at the Annual Membership Meeting. If no Lessee members are

Member qualified to vote for Lessee Representatives may vote for as many nominees
in this category as there are Lessee Representative seats to be filled.
c. Only General Members may vote to elect General Representatives unless no General
members are present at the Annual Membership Meeting. If no General Members
are present, then Lessee Members may vote to elect General Representatives. Each
Member qualified to vote for General Representatives may vote for as many
nominees in this category as there are General Representative seats to be filled.
d. All Regular Members (both Lessee and General Members) may vote to elect Public
Representatives. Each Regular Member may vote for as many Public Representative
nominees as there are Public Representative seats to be filled.
e. In each of the three categories, positions shall be filled by those candidates receiving
the largest numbers of votes in the category, though such numbers may constitute
less than a majority of the total votes cast in the category.
