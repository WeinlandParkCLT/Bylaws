5. Vacancies.
a. If any Director vacates his or her term or is removed
from the Board, the remaining Directors (though they may constitute less than a
quorum) may elect a person to fill the vacancy, or may, by unanimous agreement,
decide to leave the position vacant until the next Annual Meeting of the Membership, provided the Board still includes at least three Representatives in each category.
Elections to fill vacancies shall be by a majority of the remaining Directors.
b. Any person elected to fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors must be one who can
be reasonably expected to represent the interests of the constituents in the category
(Lessee, General, or Public) in which the vacancy occurs.
c. Replacement Directors elected by the Board shall serve out the remaining term of the
person who has vacated the position.
