a. Annual membership dues shall be assessed for each calendar year by an affirmative
vote of a majority of the Regular Members present and voting at the Annual Meeting
preceding that year. If no such action is taken to assess dues for a given year, the
dues for that year shall be as established for the previous year.

may be credited.
