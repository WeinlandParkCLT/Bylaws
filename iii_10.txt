10. Meetings of the Board of Directors.
a. Notice of Meetings. Except as provided below for emergency meetings, written notice
of a Board meeting shall be mailed to all Directors at least seven days prior to the
meeting, or shall be delivered in person or emailed at least five days prior to the
meeting. Notice of every meeting shall include an agenda for the meeting.
b. Waiver of Notice. Any Director may waive any notice required by these Bylaws. Any
Director who has not received notice of a Board meeting but has attended that

requests that his or her protest be recorded in the minutes of the meeting.
c. Annual Meeting. The Annual Meeting of the Board of Directors may be held
immediately following the Annual Membership Meeting and must be held no later
than six weeks following the Annual Membership Meeting.
d. Regular Meetings. The Board of Directors shall meet no less often than once every
two months, at such times and places as the Board may establish.
e. Special Meetings and Emergency Meetings. Special meetings may be called by the
President, by any three Directors, or by 10% of the Regular Members of the
Corporation. Notice must be given as provided above, unless any three Directors
determine that the matter at hand constitutes an emergency. When so determined, an
Emergency Meeting may be called on one-day notice. Notice of Emergency
Meetings, including an announcement of the agenda, shall be given by telephone or
in person to all Directors. At any Special or Emergency Meeting of the Board, only
those matters included in the announced agenda may be acted upon unless all of the
Directors are present at the meeting and unanimously agree to take action on other
matters.
