8. Resignation.
a. Any Director may resign at any time by giving written notice to the President.
Unless otherwise specified, such resignation shall be effective upon the receipt of
notice by the President.
b. A Director shall be considered to have given notice of resignation and his or her
position shall be declared vacant by the Board of Directors if he or she fails to attend
three consecutive meetings of the Board with the exception of emergency meetings,
unless good cause for absence and continuing interest in participation on the Board
are recognized by the Board. When a Director has failed to attend three consecutive
meetings, the President shall notify him or her in writing that, at the next regular
Board meeting, his or her position will be declared vacant unless the Board
determines that there has been good cause for the Directorâ€™s absences and that the
Director continues to be interested in participating on the Board of Directors. The
notification by the President shall be mailed no later than seven days prior to the
Board meeting at which the position may be declared vacant. At this meeting, the
Director in question shall be given the opportunity to show good cause for past
absences from meetings and continuing interest in participating on the Board. The
resignation of a Director who has missed three consecutive meetings shall not
become effective until the Board has declared the position vacant as provided herein.
