6. Recusal by Board or Committee. If the member does not voluntarily recuse herself
or himself, any Board member or committee member may request that the Board or
committee determine whether such member should be recused. Such member shall
not be present during the discussion and vote on the recusal and may not be counted in
determining the existence of a quorum at the time of such vote. In making the
decision as to recusal, the Board or committee shall keep in mind that it is the
Corporationâ€™s policy to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. If a majority of
the Board or committee votes for recusal, a quorum being present, the member shall
be immediately recused. The results of the vote shall be recorded in the minutes of the
meeting.
